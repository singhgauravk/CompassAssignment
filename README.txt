Please note that I have written the login using Python. To run the program you need can execute on a command shell (assuming python is already installed) using the command:
CMD > python assignment.py

In case python is not installed, please download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Assumptions made:
- Code is writing output to file CompassAssignmentDataExtract.csv. The program assumes the file is not in use so that it can write to the same without issues.
- Only one user's details are required from each run. If you need to get details for more than one user program needs to be run once for each user.
